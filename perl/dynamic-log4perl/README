What does it do?
----------------

The purpose is to create a perl logger that can log to different files
depending on some in-file parameters.

After running this example you should find multiple log files in log
directory. The test script iterates through values and logs them into
file, so the myriad of files will have different names and a single line
in them. All this is intended.

Note to self: in log4perl.conf there is some custom level defs - can be
used some time.

How to run it?
--------------

$ mkdir log
$ perl main.pl

And remember to have log4perl installed in your system, 'cause it does
the main work here :)
