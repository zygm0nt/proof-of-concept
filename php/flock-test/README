What it is?
-----------

How PHP's flock() should be used? The non-blocking way.

The script should try to obtain lock on file several times and if failed
just quit. It should not block waiting for lock.

How to use it?
--------------

Lock file with lock_file.php:

$ php lock_file.php

Than in other terminal run the actual test:

$ php loop_while_locking_test.php

or (if you want to see LOCK_SH behavior)

$ php loop_while_locking_test.php
